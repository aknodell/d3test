		{"title":"Polymer fume fever", "description":"Polymer fume fever or fluoropolymer fever, also informally called Teflon flu, is an inhalation fever caused by the fumes released when polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, known under the trade name Teflon) reaches temperatures of 300 °F (149 °C) to 450 °F (232 °C). When PTFE is heated above 450 °F (232 °C) the pyrolysis products are different and inhalation may cause acute lung injury.[citation needed] Symptoms are flu-like (chills, headaches and fevers) with chest tightness and mild cough. Onset occurs about 4 to 8 hours after exposure to the pyrolysis products of PTFE. A high white blood cell count may be seen and chest x-ray findings are usually minimal.", "depth":1},
		{"title":"Polytetrafluoroethylene", "description":"Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene that has numerous applications. The best known brand name of PTFE-based formulas is Teflon by Chemours.[2] Chemours is a spin-off of DuPont Co.,[3] which discovered the compound in 1938.[2]", "depth":2},
		{"title":"Pyrolysis", "description":"Pyrolysis is a thermochemical decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen (or any halogen). It involves the simultaneous change of chemical composition and physical phase, and is irreversible. The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro \"fire\" and lysis \"separating\".", "depth":2},
		{"title":"Carbon", "description":"Carbon (from Latin: carbo \"coal\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. On the periodic table, it is the first (row 2) of six elements in column (group 14), which have in common the composition of their outer electron shell. It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable while 14C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years.[14] Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.[15]", "depth":3}
